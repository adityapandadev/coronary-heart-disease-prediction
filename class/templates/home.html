<!-- What is CHD -->
<div class="container container-center w3-gradient">
<h2 align="center" class="heading-font">What is Coronary Heart Disease?</h2>
</div>
<section class="section container "><p data-aos="fade-up-left">
  <b>Coronary heart disease (CHD)</b>, or coronary artery disease, develops when the coronary arteries become 
  too narrow. The coronary arteries are the blood vessels that supply oxygen and blood to the heart. 
  CHD tends to develop when cholesterol builds up on the artery walls, creating plaques. 
  These plaques cause the arteries to narrow, reducing blood flow to the heart. A clot can sometimes obstruct 
  the blood flow, causing serious health problems. CHD can sometimes lead to heart attack. 
  CHD causes more than 17 Million Deaths Per Year Worldwide.

<!-- Risk Factors -->
<div class="container container-center w3-gradient">
  <h2 align="center" class="heading-font">Risk Factors</h2>
</div>

<section class="section container "><p data-aos="fade-up-right"><strong>Age: </strong>Genetic or lifestyle factors cause plaque to 
  build up in your arteries as you age. In men, the risk for coronary heart disease starts to increase 
  around age 45.Also, changes in the small blood vessels of the heart as you age raise the risk for coronary
   microvascular disease.<br><br>

   <strong>Gender: </strong>Coronary heart disease affects men and women. Obstructive coronary artery 
   disease is more common in men. However, nonobstructive coronary artery disease is more common in women. 
   Since the nonobstructive type is harder to diagnose, women may not be diagnosed and treated as quickly as 
   men.<br><br>

   <strong>Blood Pressure: </strong>High blood pressure is harmful to the arteries and increases
   the risk of heart attack, heart failure and stroke. The condition
   tends to run in families, but blood pressure is also influenced by
   lifestyle. To prevent blood pressure from rising, it is important to
   achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, keep alcohol intake
   moderate, reduce salt intake, manage and reduce stress and be
   physically active<br><br>

   <strong>Diabetes: </strong>People with diabetes are at a much higher risk of coronary
   heart disease. This increased risk is associated with high blood
   sugar, high blood pressure and raised blood lipids.<br><br>

   <strong>Smoking: </strong>Cigarette smoking, even a few a day, increases the risk of
   heart disease. It is also responsible for 90% of lung cancers,
   can cause cancer anywhere else in the body, bronchitis,
   emphysema and stroke. There are thus many health benefits
   from being a non-smoker. Even after having smoked for many
   years, stopping smoking now will reduce CHD risk.<br><br>

   <strong>Stress: </strong>A certain amount of stress may be desirable, in that it keeps
   people alert and motivated. However, as the stress level builds,
   especially if prolonged, it can be harmful to health.
   Stress can exacerbate symptoms in people with pre-existing
   heart disease, and can contribute to high blood pressure.
   For those with high cholesterol it can lead to neglect of a
   healthy lifestyle, such as poor eating habits or not taking
   prescribed medication. <br>

<!-- Prevent CHD -->
<div class="container container-center w3-gradient">
  <h2 align="center" class="heading-font">Prevent CHD</h2>
</div>

<section class="section container "><p data-aos="fade-up-left">
  Studies show that heart-healthy living—never smoking, eating healthy, and being physically active—throughout life can prevent coronary heart disease and its complications.
Work with your doctor to set up a plan that works for you based on your lifestyle, your home and neighborhood
 environments, and your culture. Working with a team of healthcare providers may help with making changes 
 in your diet, being physically active, managing other medical conditions, and helping you quit smoking.

<!-- What Role does Machine Learning plays-->
<div class="container container-center w3-gradient">
  <h2 align="center" class="heading-font">What Role does Machine Learning plays in Healthcare</h2>
</div>
  <section class="section container "><p data-aos="fade-up-right">Machine learning in medicine has recently made headlines.
     Google has developed a machine learning algorithm to help identify cancerous tumors on mammograms. 
     Stanford is using a deep learning algorithm to identify skin cancer. A recent JAMA article reported 
     the results of a deep machine-learning algorithm that was able to diagnose diabetic retinopathy in 
     retinal images. It’s clear that machine learning puts another arrow in the quiver of clinical decision 
     making.<br><br>
     AI and Machine Learning continue to grow in the healthcare industry with the ever-evolving technology 
     advancements. There have been more healthcare focused startups that deploy machine learning than it has 
     ever been. However machine-learning models have not been implemented to the same extent in healthcare as 
     they have been in other verticals. Firstly, machine learning is a recent technology and is far away from 
     the state of perfection. Whether its FDA, ICMR or EMA approval, it is a long, arduous and expensive 
     process to test, validate and approve the technology in a healthcare setting. Secondly, data privacy and 
     security are one of the biggest barriers of machine learning adoption in healthcare. In healthcare 
     industry, the technologies and systems must be developed so as they comply with the respective data
      laws and rules of governing organizations.
